## Hugo Theme Stack Starter Template

This is a quick start template for [Hugo theme Stack](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack). It uses [Hugo modules](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/) feature to load the theme.

It comes with a basic theme structure and configuration. GitHub action has been set up to deploy the theme to a public GitHub page automatically. Also, there's a cron job to update the theme automatically everyday.
