In this comprehensive 2023 study, I delve into the intriguing world of API architectures, focusing on the performance comparison between REST and GraphQL within microservices systems. Employing an empirical methodology, the research encompasses extensive load testing, simulating up to 80,000 requests over a minute using Gatling, in a Dockerized environment. This article presents a nuanced analysis of latency, throughput, and resource consumption, offering valuable insights for developers and architects. The findings are crucial for understanding the best API architecture choice in varied application scenarios, balancing scalability, efficiency, and practicality. I hope you enjoy it!
